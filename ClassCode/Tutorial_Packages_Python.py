##PACKAGES HAVE FUNCTIONS, DATA, CLASSES
##THE CORE OF PYTHON HAS VERY LESS FUNCTIONS
##WE NEED PACKAGES TO INCLUDE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS
##A module is simply a file containing Python definitions, functions and statements.
##Putting code into modules is useful becuase of the ability to import the module
##functionality into your script

##A package is just a way of collecting related modules together within a single tree
##like hierarchy. Very complex packages such as NumPy or SciPy have hundreds of individual
##modules so putting them into a directory-like structure keeps things organized and
##avoids name collisions
import scrapy as s
from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess
x = s.item
print(x.deepcopy.__call__.__class__)
